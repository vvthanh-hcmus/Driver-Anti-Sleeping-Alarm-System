# Driver-Anti-Sleeping-Alarm-System
Developed a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using laptop camera (OpenCV + Mediapipe). When sleepiness is detected (eye closure/yawn), a signal is sent via UART to STM32F103C8T6 to trigger LED blinking alert. Integrated Python vision module with STM32 microcontroller using PL2303HX USB-UART.
